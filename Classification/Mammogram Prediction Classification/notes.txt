1. train

converting the images to probability by group than append image_id by merging

have to predict one classification probability for each breast view

apply a convolutional network

*take your time to understand the variables a bit

only provided for train gives information on how difficult conventional techniques could identify
(density, birads, difficult_negative_case, biopsy)

tells you  if there was cancer
(cancer, invasive)

2. test



3. features?

none to engineer really *atleast that i know of  *maybe categories


4. modelling 

utilizing state of the art pretrained models as a base-line ensemble
