## Kaggle Archive (https://www.kaggle.com/neurosci)

This repo holds a collection of attempted analyses from Kaggle and other datasets. Each project folder *should* contain a Jupyter notebook with the analysis. Datasets are not committed because they cannot be stored in GitHub.

**Disclaimer: I can not guarantee that it will be the prettiest notebook**

### WIP:
* Adding project descriptions
* Organizing within folder by time
* Formatting the links to be more compact
